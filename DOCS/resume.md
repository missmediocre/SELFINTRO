# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Account Manager position. With over eight years of experience in digital advertising, account management, and client operations across Alibaba and ByteDance, I bring a proven record of driving measurable growth and building strong client relationships. 

During my tenure at Alibaba in **Shenzhen**, I independently managed complex medical and health accounts on Alibaba.com, doubling annual revenue and improving conversion rates through proactive monitoring and performance optimization. Later in **Hangzhou**, I spearheaded category operations for AliExpress home textiles, managing 30 key accounts and achieving 19% YoY GMV growth while expanding industry partnerships with over 50 factories. 

These experiences have equipped me with the skills to **develop growth strategies, provide actionable seller insights, proactively resolve performance issues, and collaborate cross-functionally** to maximize account performance. I am confident that my background in managing high-impact accounts, coupled with strong data analysis and communication skills, positions me to deliver value-added results as your next Account Manager.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to your team‚Äôs success.

Sincerely,  
**Xu Dian**
