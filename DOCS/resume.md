Cover Letter
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for the Account Manager position. With over seven years of experience in
digital advertising, category management, and client-facing roles at leading global companies such
as Alibaba and ByteDance, I have developed strong expertise in account growth, performance
optimization, and relationship management that directly aligns with your requirements.
In my role as Category Manager at Alibaba.com, I launched and managed the company’s first
Medical & Health flagship and vertical stores. By optimizing P4P and paid referral advertising
strategies, I increased valid inquiries by 3x and doubled annual revenue from USD 680K to 1.36M. I
also led three major redesigns of the medical zone, ensuring compliance while boosting conversion
rates. This experience sharpened my ability to monitor performance, identify risks, and proactively
implement improvements.
At AliExpress, I managed the Home Textile category, driving +81% YoY GMV growth (vs. industry
average +13%). I supported 30+ new merchants to reach sustainable sales of USD 20K+ per
month through guidance on assortment, marketing, and optimization. I also negotiated partnerships
with industry associations and government stakeholders, securing resources that expanded the
merchant base. This reflects my ability to develop and maximize key account relationships while
working cross-functionally.
Previously at ByteDance, I designed scalable author growth programs, including the “Bole
Program”, which contributed 35% of new quality author growth, and the “Open Class” initiative,
which added another 20%. These projects required deep data analysis, campaign metrics tracking,
and cross-team execution, all of which mirror the analytical and collaborative skills you value in this
role.
With a Master’s degree in Journalism & Communication, professional certifications (IELTS 7.5,
CATTI Translation & Interpretation, TEFL), and hands-on experience across global platforms, I
bring both the strategic insights and execution ability to independently manage complex accounts
and deliver business growth.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to your team. Thank you for
considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value
as your next Account Manager.
Sincerely,
Xu Dian (Selma Xu)
